# Simple Language Recognizer in C++
## Author: [Jack Robbins]("https://github.com/jackr276")

This project is the full implementation of of a simple langauge recognizer. Given a file, [RA7Prog.cpp]("https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Language-Recognizer/blob/main/RA7Prog.cpp") will go through the file line by line, and call the inLanguage function in the [inLanguage.cpp]("https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Language-Recognizer/blob/main/inLanguage.cpp")
file that analyzes the sentence, according to the following Langauge Sentence Rule: **Language Rules: L = {S#S’ , where S is a possibly empty string other than #, and S’ = reverse(S)}**. Appropriate messages are then printed out.
